#the only way that you can buy tickets, is through a single python script.
#create a single console app to buy tickets using a command line program where no one would expect it.


# User should be shown the number of ticket left remaining so s/he can understand importance of buying now
# User should have a personalized experience to feel welcomed by the brand
# User should have errors reported in a User-friendly manner
# User should be able to request a certain amount tof tickets and be told the total cost so s/he can determine
#       whether to buy
# User should not be offered tickets if there aren't any available
# User should be able to confirm purchase to avoid buying more than intended
# Run this code until we run out of tickets
