# First we need to declare the variable and give it an '=' symbol to give the variable an identity.
# We write: favorite_color =

# then, we need to define what the variable actually means.
# The challenge asks to as for a user input which means we need the 'input()' function.
# The parameters (the parentheses) will prompt the user with what you put in it.
# we write: favorite_color = input("What is your favorite color?")

# Now we have a variable named 'favorite_color' and it will equal whatever the user enters upon being prompted.
# input always returns a string - you have to add int to input then wrap with () to coerce an integer
    #ex age = int(input("How old are you?  "))

# This is what the line of code should look like in the editor:

favorite_color = input("What is your favorite color?")

# Use the favorite_color variable in your print function to output the following message to the screen :
# The color [USER INPUTTED COLOR] is a great color!

print("The color {} is a great color!".format(favorite_color))
