    then run git commit -m "message here" to complete the deletion

git reset HEAD: let's you unstage a file

git checkout -- : discard changes to a file automatically (make sure you aren't deleting stuff you want)

deletions can be undone with git checkout -- :  in this case, the change we want to discard is the deletion of the file -
    this will bring the file back.

 git revert HEAD: shortcut to revert the most recent commit made
